# Binary and Decimal

## bit About?

**Decimal** - `Base10` 

**Binary** - `Base2`

### Decimal to Binary

Example: 192

|             | 192         | 
| :---        |    :----:   |          
| 2           | 96   `0`    | 
| 2           | 48   `0`    |
| 2           | 24   `0`    |
| 2           | 12   `0`    |
| 2           | 6    `0`    |
| 2           | 3    `0`    |
| 2           | 1    `1`    |
| 2           | 0    `1`    |
|             |             |


*In the column reperenstation above we divide 192 with 2 {school??} now once on division if we get remainder as 0 we mark it as zero and if we get a non-zero remainder we mark that as 1 and once we are completely done we can arrange the 1's and zero's from bottom to come up with the binary repersentation, also note that if the resulting the repersentation is not 8 digits we can add 0's in the starting to complete 8 digits length*

**Thus Binary for 192** - `11000000`

### Binary to Decimal

Example: 11000000

*For converting Binary to decimal what we can do is arrange this given binary number and mark it from 0 to X*

 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
 
*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0*

*now once this is marked we will only consider the binary 1's and then we will note the numbers marked on them.*

1 1 

*7 6*
